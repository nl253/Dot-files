Summary of dialogue
LB
Introductions to those present and clarification of role of Investigations Office. Also explained role of translator/interpreter was not to represent IL but to assist her with any difficulty in understand.  Explained need for confidentiality and that the purpose of the meeting was to gain more information into her version of events in respect of the allegations made and also obtain more clarification on the contents of the statement that has been submitted.  Although I would usually ask at the end of the meeting for your to spend time reading the notes and then if you are in agreement with the contents for us both to sign them, I am conscious that you do have a translator here today so as you have already given your email address I will forward the notes for you to read.  If after reading the notes there are any elements that you do not agree with, I would ask you to list these and your points will be reviewed in line with the notes taken today.  Firstly is there anything within the allegations that you do not understand, not that you don’t agree with but that you don’t understand?  
IL
I understand 
LB
How long have you been at QEC?  
IL
6 years approximately, from 2011
LB
What training have you completed?
IL
Mandatory and I think it is in date, not done medication training
LB
Was there anything within the training that you didn’t understand?
IL
Most of it yes, if I didn’t understand I would ask questions.  Have requested conflict at work training and other suggestions have been made
LB
Go to the first allegation which was raised as detailed in the letter dated 23.5.17 which states it is alleged that on the 23.4.17 you shouted at EW in an unacceptable manner whilst in JH’s bedroom attending an emergency call bell.  Can you describe JH to me?
IL
Ex footballer of Arsenal, lovely gent with Parkinsons, in his late 70’s.  Likes to chat, looked after by care assistants and his family members, because of his Parkinsons he is unsteady and losing his balance, had fallen on the floor
LB
Who was first to the room?
IL
I cant remember, I don’t think its that important
LB
What is the procedure when the emergency bell is activated?
IL
If its an emergency on residential, staff go there and all available staff respond
LB
How many staff ended up in JH’s room?
IL
Sure the nurse was with JH; I remember him leaning and bleeding, shocked and in pain, stuck between the window sill and the armchair
LB
What instructions was the nurse giving?
IL
She was co-operating with me
LB
Can you describe where the resident, nurse and other staff members were?
IL









There was another person but I cant remember who
LB
You stated in your response that the reason you raised your voice was so she could hear over the nurse, can you described what you mean and what tone you used when you “raised your voice”?
IL
Not sure if the tv was on, I wanted to be heard, never shouted at her, sorry she took it that way, not my intention, I wanted to concentrate on the resident, my aim was to be heard
LB
You have put in your written statement that you suggested she go back, what did you say to her?
IL
I cant remember exactly, said we could deal with JH; they were short staffed on nursing, she was stood there and could be more helpful somewhere else.  My instinct is if I see a resident on the floor I react.  I don’t understand why she stood there and not offering support, not getting the hoist
LB
How long was she in the room before she left?
IL
She did nothing, that’s why I reacted, I thought if not doing anything go to where they are short staffed
LB
How long was she in the room?
IL
I concentrated on the resident
LB
Anything else you want to add on this allegation?
IL
No 
LB
You have put a paragraph in your statement about a resident called Phyllis.  I am confused as this is not part of any of the allegations so I don’t understand the relevance?
IL
I wrote this, I was describing a situation where she put me in an uncomfortable position
LB
What date was this?
IL
I don’t write dates, I’m getting on with my job
LB
You have written about her being a liar, is this your example of her making you out to be a liar?
IL
Yes I was shocked
LB
But how do you know she heard you?
IL
She was there with me, I know she heard
LB
Let’s move onto the second allegation which is that it is alleged that on the 17.5.17 you made threats towards JR following a meeting with AR stating words to the effect of “Jodie did you report me? I cant believe you’ve done that, I’ll remember that”.  In your statement you say that on this date you met a new member of staff MZ; you introduced yourself and asked if she was an agency staff member, if it was her first shift, if she had worked in care settings before.  You say she only gave you her name and then ignored the rest of your questions and just stood there chewing gum.  Her body language and blank expression gave you the feeling she was ignoring you so you stood up and left the office.  What colour uniform did she have on?
IL
Blue, doesn’t matter as sometimes agency staff wear blue
LB
Did she have a name badge on?
IL
I cant remember
LB
Which shift leader office were you in?
IL
The one down from Michelle’s office
LB
Was there anyone else in there?
IL
No 
LB
What did you say to her when you first went in?
IL
When I entered I introduced myself then I asked if she is agency 
LB
Did she say anything back to you?
IL
Gave me her name
LB
What do you mean by her body language, can you describe this?
IL
Chewing gum; basically ignored me, I was asking questions about work
LB
Was this at handover?
IL
In the morning, cant remember the time
LB
Was she part of the allocation of staff?
IL
I don’t know, I cant remember the details
LB
Where was JR?
IL
In a residents room
LB
If JR was allocated with DF, were you allocated to work with her?
IL
That is what I tried to find out, ignored me that is why I left the office
LB
What did JR say when you saw her?
IL
She just listened to me, told her I was going to deliver care to those who needed one carer
LB
When did you find out she was permanent staff?
IL
I never found out, I don’t know if she was bank, saw her only once, still don’t know what her position is.  I was trying to find out if she was shadowing me, her knowledge of the resident to see if she needed to work with me or on her own.  I have been here 6 years so feel I have a responsibility to the residents
LB
What did AR say to you when she called you in?
IL
Told me she was told I didn’t want to work with her, I said I didn’t want to work in general, I didn’t specifically name anyone, I cant remember the exact words.  I’d come on duty to do my job, maybe AR had the wrong information
LB
What did she ask you?
IL
Told me I didn’t want to work
LB
Did you not challenge her if that was not correct?
IL
I cant remember, told her of course I want to work, I was joking
LB
What were you joking about?
IL
Said to JR after MZ had acted towards me “I don’t want to work today”.  It looks like JR went to the office and said I didn’t want to work but I was joking, I did want to carry on as I went and did those who required one person
LB
Where did you go when you came out of the office?
IL
I was working and answering the bells
LB
How long after you came out of the office did you see JR?
IL
I cant remember, just get on with my job, still on early shift
LB
Where did you see JR?
IL
First floor residential
LB
What was the conversation you had with her?
IL
I cant remember, I cant remember details, just asked did you report me?
LB
Were you upset?
IL
Very 
LB
What did you mean when you said to her “I’ll remember”?
IL
Means I’ll remember that
LB
Do you think JR could have seen that as threatening?
IL
I wasn’t, its like a chess move or cooking a recipe, you remember it.  My intention wasn’t to threaten, I said it because I was shocked.  I always looked after her when she was a new starter without a lot of experience
LB
In respect of what you have just said regarding a chess move or a recipe, these are things that you remember as there is an end product with it.  If you cook a recipe and it is good, you do remember it because there has been an end product to it, if you are given a chess move and you use that move to win the game, you remember it as it helped you win the game and you use the move again in another game therefore it is an end product.  When you said that to JR did she say anything to you?
IL
She confirmed she reported me, said yes I did.  I sent you a letter from relatives about the breast cancer, I was on duty the day the GP came and we had the conversation with the daughter and she said it was you Izabela and she said she didn’t put my name on the letter but she could remember my face
LB
I have it here, you sent it to me.  (LB read letter).  Is there anything further you want to add on this allegation?
IL
No 
LB
Can we now go to the second letter you received dated 1.6.17.  The first allegation is that it is alleged that on the 20.3.17 at 11:00 am you spoke in an aggressive manner to OF when she asked you what work was to be done.  It is further alleged you spent the rest of the day avoiding and ignoring OF.  What I have established is that on this day you were making the drinks and she was making the beds.  OF has stated that she approached you and asked if you had noticed if there were any other beds to make to which you responded by saying “I’ve done enough work, I have done enough and I’m not doing it”.  Do you remember any conversation like this?
IL
Conversations like this every day
LB
Do you remember if any conversation because heated?
IL
She has a bossy way, I don’t know anyone from that country, thought this is her way.  As long as we communicate what needs to be done and its done, she appears bossy
LB
Do you remember any incident then when she has behaved bossy when you have been making the drinks and she has been making the beds?
IL
I cant remember the times but she is generally bossy, different culture and that is fine, not harmful to me.  This lady is a very nice person, she is a good carer
LB
You say in your written response that English is not our native language or perfect and we may express ourselves too each other differently and because of this things may have been misunderstood.  What do you think could be the misunderstanding?
IL
When she is acting a bit bossy I thought that is the way she is and it is her culture, I thought I will get on with my work and it’s the way she is.  On top of this really nice person, never took it the wrong way
LB
Anything else on this allegation?
IL
No I don’t remember
LB
Move onto the next.  It is alleged that on 22.3.17 at 07:35 am in the residential duty room during handover you showered OF with insulting comments and said to her in a sarcastic manner “you are the boss, so you tell us who is doing what and with whom”.  When OF asked you why you thought she was the bossy you replied she behaves like on.  Do you remember this incident?
IL
Amazing how she remembers.  Each allegation is two months ago, incredible someone can remember exact times and dates two months later, I’m just getting on with my work
LB
Do you remember the incident where you called her the boss?
IL
Yes I do
LB
Do you remember the conversation?
IL
No, I’m just getting on with my job
LB
If you don’t remember the specific incident, have you called her the boss before?
IL
I don’t remember
LB
Anything else on this allegation?
IL
No 
LB
Next allegation is it is alleged that on the 10.4.17 when assisting resident BW to wash and dress you shouted at OF “Lena stop stressing me, you are stressing me”.  You have in your statement acknowledged this date however you say she told you she was stressed.  Can you remember where you were when she told you this?
IL
Shift leaders office but I don’t know who was there, it was after the handover.  I remember her saying after handover, we went to residential and she was saying she was stressed, she admitted it herself 
LB
Talk me through what happened in the room?
IL
Don’t remember the details, found out in the morning he was going to hospital and she was stressed
LB
You have put in your statement that she was rushing around an rushing the resident and you asked her to calm down and try not to be stressed as there was no reason, you also say you explained to her that the way she was acting in the residets room could possibly stress him out and she did not like you for telling her that.  When you asked her to calm down what did she say?
IL
Said not stressed, didn’t want to listen to me, carrying on
LB
You say she didn’t like for you telling her, how did you know she didn’t like you telling her?
IL
Way she said, way she reacted, didn’t take my advise, just carried on getting the resident ready.  The general atmosphere in the room was poor, the resident could feel it, she was rushing him and I was trying to calm her down and she didn’t like it.  She is not a bad person, tried to get the resident ready but I told her a few times
LB
If you were only told that morning the resident was going to hospital, how long did you have to get him ready?
IL
He was the first resident after handover?
LB
What time was the ambulance coming, was it first thing?
IL
I cant remember?
LB
You then say in your statement that you asked OF to go to the Home Manager Michelle and have a chat about her being stressed and the possible effect this could have on the resident, how did that conversation start?
IL
I offered it, I thought she was stressed because she maybe ill, her family  but she strongly declined it
LB
Why didn’t you go to the Home Manager on your own if you thought she was affecting the resident and she had denied the offer?
IL
We’re all stressed.  At that moment I was thinking it would go away, an hour before she mentioned she was stressed as she had become a grandmother, we’ve all got a life outside work, we’re all stressed, I should have reported her but I offered her to go
LB
How did she answer you?
IL
Said it in a stressful way so I left her
LB
Did you carry on working with her after this?
IL
I was looking after residents who needed one care assistant
LB
Did you see her again that shift?
IL
It is a large unit, don’t see one another for hours, I don’t know if she was stressed when I saw her again
LB
Anything else you want to add on this allegation?
IL
No 
LB
On the next allegation, number 4 of this letter where it states it is alleged that on the 17.4.17 you incited Iwona to join in bullying OF following an incident in the kitchen relating to OF’s mug.  You have put in your statement that you are unable to respond to this allegation as you are not aware of it happening.  Can you remember a time when you were in the kitchen and OF came in looking for her mug which had sunflowers on it?
IL
I cant understand this, I am not aware of it happening
LB
It was a time when you and Iwona were in the kitchen and OF came to look for her mug and couldn’t find it?
IL
I am not aware of this
LB
We’ll move on then.  The last allegation which is that on the 8.5.17 at approximately 12 pm when attending to resident G you spoke in an aggressive and impatient manner to your colleague OF and said words to the effect of “Lena did you ring the bell, why, you knew I was coming to help you … I told you I will come.  OK, never mind, enough I am not doing it”.  Where is G located?
IL
Room 6 in Rhuddlan corridor
LB
Were you allocated to work with OF that day?
IL
Not necessarily, I went to help to do the transfer
LB
When had OF asked you for assistance?
IL
I don’t remember if I asked her or she helped me, I was helping her
LB
You say in your statement you were distracted, who distracted you?
IL
Probably JH but I cant remember
LB
You have written in your response that as you walked away you told OF you would be coming back in a minute, do you know if she heard you say you’ll come back?
IL
Think so
LB
When you said it did she acknowledge you?
IL
I cant remember?
LB
Where were you when you heard the bell?
IL
Still on the ground floor
LB
With JH?
IL
I cant remember, there are 4 screens
LB
If you were in with JH where is the nearest screen?
IL
Near G’s room but I cant remember
LB
How long after from when you were distracted did OF ring the bell?
IL
Straight away
LB
What did you say when you walked in the room?
IL
I asked why ring the bell, didn’t seem any logic why she rang it straight away, I told her I would be back
LB
What did you say after “why did you ring the bell”?
IL
No conversation asked why ring the bell
LB
What did she say back to you?
IL
Cant remember, not sure if she said anything
LB
OF in her statement says you said “Lena why did you ring the bell, why, you knew I was coming to help you, I told you will come, OK, never mind, enough, I am not doing it, I will send somebody else” did you say that?
IL
I told her when I was walking behind her, someone was shouting and I told her I will come back in a minute
LB
No that wasn’t my question, did you say “Lena why did you ring the bell, why, you knew I was coming to help you, I told you will come, OK, never mind, enough, I am not doing it, I will send somebody else”?
IL
I said it but not all of it, I didn’t say OK never mind, enough, I am not doing it.  No logic to me saying that.  I never said OK, never mind, enough I will send someone else
LB
Did you do the transfer with OF?
IL
No I think another member came in
LB
Did they come as a response to the bell or did you ask them?
IL
I don’t know, so many things to do in the day and it was a long time ago.  I got the impression she rang as she didn’t want to work with me
LB
You say in your last paragraph that as nationals from other countries we can perhaps very easily misunderstand each other when expressing ourselves.  On my   part in the past if I have expressed myself in a way that another member of staff have felt uncomfortable with, it would have been better if it had been sorted at the time with either the team leader or home manager rather than left.  Why didn’t you report these things?
IL
I was getting on with the job, not gossiping, Welsh and British do not understand me and I don’t understand them.  Multi-cultural society and if you want to understand you will if you don’t you wont.  I get on with the job and not gossip.  (IL has requested the following be added:  Perhaps you misunderstood me here, I did not mean that. In fact my former partner with whom I'd been in relationship for years is Welsh and many of my friends are Welsh and English. I was making a point about the UK being a multicultural society with people sometimes choosing what they want to understand or not to.)
LB
I have nothing else to ask.  Do you feel you have had the opportunity to express yourself, with the help of the translator and put your side across?
IL
Yes but I would like to add that I don’t know why I am here but happy that I got to express myself with Ewa here.  The situation with 7 allegations especially with the second one is very strange for me and I cant understand it.  I suggested to OF to go to the manager with me when she was distressed.  At the time I cannot understand why she waited 10 weeks, if she felt there was a problem why not want to solve it right away, suggested a time for resolutions to happen and OF didn’t co-operate. Very strange and suspicious that from the letter with five allegations it is very precise with dates and times when she gives allegations.  Situation is very unpleasant for me and I have never been suspended in my life, I hardly find words to describe how I feel, in complete shock when I received them.  All those allegations could have been solved at the time by a team leader and not turned into a big issue.  I am surprised at the moment and made me stressed.  Feel ill and I would like to also say I do appreciate my job at the RMBI, they let me develop my wings with different training in dementia. Would love to keep this job as I don’t see reason in the allegations as they should be sorted out in the beginning.  It is very strange it appeared a week after first allegations were put in.  would put that together with how I was escorted out of the building, people there, wasn’t confidential or private, I believe it is a witch hunt against me.  Thank you
LB
I have your email address and I will try to send these to you tomorrow however I promise they will be with you by Saturday.  You will be asked to review them and make separate notes for consideration against the hand written notes.  

Meeting closed

After submitting the notes to IL to review, IL has added the following to her notes:
In our discussion I also should have mentioned that the conflict with OF may be because OF had asked me if she could have my written QCF3 work. However, I did not respond as I thought this was inappropriate. It is possible that she has contrived or exacerbated the allegations because of this.
To the best of my knowledge all I have said is true although human memory is not perfect and I might have made minor mistakes when recalling the events.

The notes taken at the meeting have been signed emailed to Izabela Logiewa to review.  I agree that this is a fair representation of our conversation.
Signed:    ……………………………………………………….   Date:  ……………………….
