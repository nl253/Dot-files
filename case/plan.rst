**28th of April**
Formal complaint by Ewelina Kwiatkowska about the incident in John's
room. Allegedly Izabela shouted at Ewelina Kwiatkowska whilst assisting a
resident in a compromised poisition.

**16th of May**
Anne Reed interviews Demi Farell.

.. note::

    During the meeting demi states:
    "[...] not shouting but not normal speaking voice [...]".
    "[...] Isabella said  [...]" - not shouted.

**17th of May**
Anne Reed interviews Edora Cuc, the nurse that was in the room at the time
alleged incident in John's room took place.

She denied that there was anything inappropriate in the conversation the
staff had in the room.

    AR: "Did you hear any conversation between the staff that you thought was wrong?"
    EC: "No I thing everything was fine and appropriate."

.. note::

   this contradicts the claims of Ewlina about Izabela "shouting", still
   Izabela is suspended based on the allegation that she shouted at Ewelina.

**17th of May**
Jodie Roberts files a formal complaint, saying that Isabella "[...] off
the top of her voice [...]"

.. important::

    If Isabella shouted off the top of her voice, then surely others will have
    heard that. Somone in the corridor must have heard.

    Where are the witnesses that could confirm that she shouted
    "off the top of her voice"?

    Could Demi, the only eyewitness confirm that?

    Why wasn't she questioned about that before suspending Izabela?

    Michelle did not attempt to verify Jodie's claims before proceeding
    with suspension.


**22nd of May 5pm**
Izabela Logiewa suspended based on these two allegations.

.. note::

    They are not fully conistent with what Demi stated. They are exagerrated.

Walked out of the building in such a way that everyone could see that she
has been suspended.

She had been accused of two allegations, one about threatening Jodie and
the other one about shouting at E. Kwiatkowska.

.. note::

   The "shouting" by Izabela is not consistent with the information given
   by Demi on the 16th of May.

**30th of May**
Olena files a formal complaint full of allegations with some, suspiciously,
dating back a over two months.

.. container::

    20th of March
        - Delay: 11 days until end of march + 30 days whole April + 30 days of May = 2 months + almost 2 weeks

    22nd of March
        - Delay: 9 days until end of march + 30 days whole April + 30 days of May = 2 months + 1 weeks

    10th of April
        - Delay: 20 days until end of April + 30 days of May = 50 days = 1 month + almost 3 weeks

    17th of April
        - Delay: 13 days until end of April + 30 days of May = 43 days = 1 month + almost 2 weeks

    8th of May
        - Delay: 22 days

.. note::

    Until the 30th of May Olena did not mention any of this (which is over 2
    months)to a shift leader or a home manager.

    If she was so upset and she was strugging as much as she claimed,
    then why not report it before to a shift leader or the home manager?

    Why not attempt to resolve it peacefully at the time it took place?

    She did not even attempt to resolve these issues with Isablla.

    It is only after Isabella had been publicly walked out of the home that
    she decided to recall these events. Perhaps to take advantage of this
    opporutnity to get Izabela sacked.

    In fact Olena admits that Isabella apologised for calling her a boss. Which,
    one would think, ends the issue.

    This puts into question her very vivid and highly emotional statements
    of how much this hurt her. Especially that it's almost impossible to
    remember things this well after such a long time. Given how long it has been, can these allegations be exaggerated?

    Furthermore, in the interview between the investigator officer Iwona
    did say that threre was some sort of conflict between Izabela and
    Olena. Izabela, as Iwona recalls, complained that Olena is not treating
    her right. Could these allegations be exagerrated and caused by this
    conflict.

    If she was so upset by that then why not take any action for two months.


.. important::

    As a result the number of allegations rose to 7.

**29th June**
The investigator office interviews Olena Freya.

**10th of July**
Michelle Beer Hand delivered documentation. She also informs, that the
disciplinary meeting is on the 18th of July.

Allegations
-----------

Raising voice in the presence of a resident in a compromised position
======================================================================

Making a comment that could be interpreted by some as potentially threatning
=============================================================================

Showing annoyance after a coworker ignored her
===============================================

Calling a coworker bossy
=========================

It is important to highlight that the conflict between Izabela and Olena
is two-sided. This is something that is missing from Olena's exagerated descriptions.

Olena fails to report on how she frequently made Izabela feel and how
that affected Izabela's mental health.  She did not, for instance, mention how Izabela,
because of how stressful working with Olena was, dropped a tea-tray, how
her hands were shaking. Nor did she mention how Izabela attempted to resolve
the conflict peacefuly by going to the home manager as soon as it happened.

In fact, it appears that Olena wasn't interested in resolving the issue,
instead, she patiently waited for an appropriate opportunity and filed a formal
complaint at the time that Izabela was most vulnerable.

Olena's report might lead somone to believe that this is a case of bullying
rather that a conflict between two coworkers.

Olena in her complaint suggests that she was in tears and her legs were
like jeylly after alleged incidents with Izabela.

This is a questionable claim. If that was the case, i.e. if Izabela trully
cause so much stress and anxiety to Olena, then why didn't she report
it sooner? How did she manage to successfully carry out her duties with
Izabela for two months without mentioning anything about it to anyone?

She has had to work numerous times with Izabela since end of March.
Why didn't she mention the conflict to a shift leader or the home manager?

Izabela, like Olena, was not happy with the way things were between them. This
is supported by a stement made by Iwona who said that Izabela often mentioned
that Olena is not treating her right.  If Olena was not acting inappropriate
in the first place, would Izabla call her bossy?

The issue here is the unlike Olena Izablea did not deal with the conflict
by collecting data against her work colegue only to release it when it was
certain it would lead to sacking.

Instead Izabela decided not make a big deal out of it.
