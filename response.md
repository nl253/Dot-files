# Correction of notes from meeting on the 29th of June 2017

Not all acronyms are labelled which makes it unclear what these statements
mean.

AR - Anne Reed?
ARE?
M - Michaella?

"What training have you completed?"

I have done mandatory training but I am not sure if it's up to date. I haven't
done medication training.

"Most of it yes, if I didn’t understand I would ask questions.
Have requested conflict at work training and other suggestions have been
made."

Just to clarify, most of it I did understand and when I did not, I would ask
questions.

"It it’s an emergency on residential, staff from there go and all available
staff respond"

I meant that if there is an emergency on residential, when it's rung,
staff go there and all available staff respond.

"Sure nurse was with JH; I remember him leaning and bleeding, shocked and
in pain, stuck between the window sill and the armchair"

I meant that I was sure that the nurse was with John.

Regarding the picture, ... [DO AT HOME]

"You have put in your written statement that she suggested she go back,
what did you say to her?"

I did not put in my written statement that "she suggested she go back",
I wrote that I suggested that she should go back.

"I can’t remember exactly, said we could deal with JH; they were
short staffed on nursing, she was stood there and could be more helpful
somewhere else.  My instinct is if I see a resident on the floor I react.
I don’t understand why she stood there and not offering support, not
getting the hoist"

I did not say that she was not "getting the hoist". I mentioned the hoist when
giving examples of acting immediately in response to an emergency situation.

"Yes I was shocked", followed by a "?" is not clear. I do not understand what
it refers to.

"[...] following a meeting with ARE stating words to the [...]"
by ARE do you mean Anne Reed (AR)?

After "Blue, doesn’t matter as agency staff wear blue" I would add
sometimes.

"What did you say to her when you first went in?"

When I entered the room, I first introduced myself then asked if she
was an agency staff.

"Told me she was told I didn’t want to work with her"

I said I didn't want to work in general. I didn't say I didn't want to work
with anyone specifically.

"I always looked after her when she was a new starter with a lot of
experience"

Here I meant "without" a lot of experience.

"I was on duty the day the GP came and we had the conversation with the
daughter and she said it was you Izabela and she said she didn’t put my
name on the letter but she could remember my face"

I don't remember mentioning that, in fact I cannot remember the exact details
about the GP and who was on duty that day.

"OF has stated that she approached you and asked if you had noticed if there
were any other beds to make to which you responded by saying “I’ve done
enough work, I have done enough and I’m not doing it”"

I do not recall replying "Conversations like this every day" I must have
misunderstood the question. I certainly do not have conversations like that
every day.

Furthermore, this was not part of the allegations sent to me in the letter.

## Page 7

Here I did not express myself clearly enough but I did say to Lena "Why did you ring the bell when you knew I was coming to assist you". I did not say "OK, never mind enough I will send somebody else".

"[...] Welsh and British do not understand me and I don’t understand them."

Perhaps you misunderstood me here, I did not mean that.  In fact my previous partner with whom I'd been in relationship for years was Welsh and many of my friends are Welsh and English.

I was making a point about the UK being a multicultural society with people sometimes choosing what they want to understand or not to.

In our discussion I also should have mentioned that the conflict with OF may be because Olena had asked me if she could have my written QFC3 work.  However, I did not respond as I thought this was inappropriate.  It is possible that she has contrived or exacerbated the allegations because of this.

To the best of my knowledge all I have said is true although human memory is not perfect and I might have made minor mistakes when recalling the events.
